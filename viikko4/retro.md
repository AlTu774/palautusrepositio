“Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel” is a technique where 5 different categories are used to discuss what could be done to improve the project working. On this wheel, the team asks itself what new thing they should consider doing (Start), what should they stop doing (Stop), or what the project could use more of or less of (More, Less). The session should be about 10 to 25 minutes.

In a “Glad, Sad, Mad” type retrospective each team member can write on notes observations or opinions on the sprint. Each note is categorized positively or negatively in the “Glad”, “Sad” or “Mad” categories. The notes are then divided on a whiteboard based on their categories. The Scrum master leads the discussion on the observations. The length of the sessions is up to 60 minutes.
